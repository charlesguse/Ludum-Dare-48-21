Run Escape

Requirements:
Windows PC (Sorry Linux and Mac :( I am learning PyGame to make this not be an issue in the future!)
XNA 4.0 redistributable
C# 4.0 redistributable

To play:
Press Escape to start, jump, and resume running after stopped.
Press Space to stop.

Jump from platform to platform. The platforms are lines of comments and code from the game.

You win if you can make it through all of the C# files!

Trouble shooting:
If the game does not work try installing the XNA and C# redistributables.
